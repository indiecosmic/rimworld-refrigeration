RimWorld Refrigeration Mod
==========================
Refrigeration is a mod for the sci-fi colony sim [RimWorld](https://www.google.com "RimWorld").

It adds a refrigerator to the game (along with a research project) which extends the shelf-time of prepared meals as long as the food is placed inside the refrigerator and the fridge is powered.

The refrigerator works as an ordinary storage spot, which lets colonists to place and take away meals without any extra player action required.

## How to install
- Unzip the contents and place them in your RimWorld/Mods folder.
- Activate the mod in the mod menu in the game.

## How to use
- Research the refrigeration project.
- Build a refrigerator and make sure it has got power.

## Notes
This is my first real attempt at a RimWorld mod for use by other players. Feel free to post opinions, ideas, bug reports, etc in the [Issues](/issues) section.
