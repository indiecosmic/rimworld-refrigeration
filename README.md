RimWorld Refrigeration Mod
==========================
Refrigeration is a mod for the sci-fi colony sim [RimWorld](https://www.google.com "RimWorld").

It adds a refrigerator to the game (along with a research project) which extends the shelf-time of prepared meals as long as the food is placed inside the refrigerator and the fridge is powered.

The refrigerator works as an ordinary storage spot, which lets colonists to place and take away meals without any extra player action required.
